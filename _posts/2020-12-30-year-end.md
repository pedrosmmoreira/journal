While not usually in the habit of the "yearly reflection", I guess 2020 was
certainly a year to warrant it. So here it is, a reflection written at the end
of an extremely long December, after a year where time acquired a certain
elasticity, making it simultaneously both grindingly slow and fast.

This elasticity of time has certainly felt like the hallmark of the year for me:
professionally, January to June were spent in a transition period between
leaving [Specle] and joining [Char.gy].

Leaving a company after 5 years spent fighting tooth and nail for its growth and
survival at CTO level is never an easy transition - doing it while the world went
haywire somehow made it feel more stressful. Saying goodbye over a Slack call
isn't the closure I'd have hoped for, but it was the possible one. Time went
slow, then went really fast.

I decided not to take time off between jobs since "well, we are in lockdown anyway,
whats the point?". This turned out to be a mistake. As many of you certainly
felt, the transition to working in a family environment during the (several)
lockdowns was brutal.

This is my sixth year of full time remote and I have never
been so exhausted by it: coordinating two adults taking calls and meetings, a 7
year old with now a full schedule of calls and meetings, and trying not to leave
a 2 year old left to his own devices entirely is just something we were not
prepared for.

We did manage to take a small break and go away a couple of days in the summer.
It helped, but nowhere near enough to break free from the fatigue of
confinement. At least, we had those days - and those memories - and that is both
incredibly fortunate and good.

Another theme that kept recurring along the year was exactly that: of being
fortunate that we have the jobs we have, and that our family is safe and doing
well in the face of such adversity.

What was for us a year that ground along in its roller coaster of fast and slow,
was mostly just tiring. Not devastating, not marked by permanent loss - just
tiring. For that I am again humbled and thankful. Wish we could all say the
same.

Somewhere around July, I decided to bring this site back online and attempt to
write a bit. I started doing weekly notes, but fell off the wagon rather quick.
I am hoping to do better next year, perhaps not trying to keep to weekly
updates, but doing monthly instead (much like [Hugo] recommended to me on
Twitter).

I did manage to get [started streaming on Twitch], which was a goal for the year.
And... I managed to fall off that wagon as well. Mostly, I stopped streaming
when I started to feel the first warning signs of burn out in November.

Streaming is something I very much enjoy - more than I thought I would, to be
honest. But what started as a way to do work on side projects, ended up being an
excuse to start more side projects instead of actually finishing anything. So,
I'll need to reflect on what I want to get from it and how it should fit in to
the puzzle.

I am also very thankful to everyone that follow me on Twitch and show their support.
I was in no way expecting that 24 (24!) people would have any interest in watching
me write some code on stream. Thank you all!

That being said, at this point, I am still in protective mode.
Avoiding anything that adds pressure and involves sitting in front of the computer,
and spending as much time with my family as possible.

I am not making any grand plans, goals or designs for the coming year. Like all
of us, I deeply want a return to more familiar life, but most of all I simply
wish for all be safe and well. Writing, streaming and side projects will all
have their place I am sure, but I am not rushing anything.

It has felt good to sit here and talk a little - or ramble alot - about this
year. Let's see what the new one has in store.

Wishes of an Happy 2021 to us all!
