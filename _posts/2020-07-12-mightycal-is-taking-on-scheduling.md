I am a huge fan of the [Art of Product] podcast: it is great entertainment and
so valuable hearing [Ben Orenstein] and [Derrick Reimer] openly discussing
bringing life into their businesses. [Tuple] is an amazing product, truly best
of breed, and I have high hopes for [Mightycal] to reach the same heights in its
respective market!
